Using recent rainfall figures to predict Newtown Creek sewer overflows
===

<!-- introduction -->

## Data source
We received a book from a FOIA request. This book contains graphs of, among
other things, sewer overflow incidents in New York City during the top 10
storms of 2011 for each of the 14 sewage treatment plants.

> Dates of the top ten storms, in the order they are presented in the book
> 
> 8/14/2011
> 8/27/2011
> 9/6/2011
> 3/6/2011
> 4/16/2011
> 11/22/2011
> 10/29/2011
> 9/23/2011
> 5/17/2011
> 12/7/2011

For each of these 10 storms, the graphs present a 48-hour or 60-hour window
of data around the storm. This results in a total of 7720 observation-hours,
with one observation per hour.
